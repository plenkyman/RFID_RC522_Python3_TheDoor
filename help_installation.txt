Raspian Jessie March 2016 Kernel 4.1
additional installs: mysql, pymysql, pypy, numpy, MySQLWorkbench
installs from Florian's tutorial: bcm2835, rpi-rc522, subversion

#############################		Installation Hardware		#######################

Make Hardware install:
   - RC522 RFID: VCC- pin 1, 3.3 volts | RST- pin 22, GPIO25 | GND- pins, 6, 9, 14, 20, or 25,
     MISO- pin 21, GPIO9 | MOSI- pin 19, GPIO10 | SCK- pin 23, GPIO11 | NSS- pin 24, GPIO7
     IRQ- Don’t Attach to rpi	
   - install 4 LEDS (GPIO(green,red,yellow,pstat) to LED to resistor to Ground)
   - install relay (VCC to 5V+, GPIO(d_strike) to IN1, Ground to Ground)
   - install exit button (GPIO(d_exit) to NO, Ground to Ground)

#############################		Installation Software		#######################
download and transfer raspian Jessie to SD Card from https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/

Full Desktop Jessie March 2016 Kernel 4.1 

start Raspberry with screen, keyboard and mouse connected, it will start up in X by default.

set up raspi with user "pi", establish internet connection, go thru basic setup:
   - set password, hostname, use device tree, Console Autologin Text console,
    automatically logged in as 'pi' user, enable SPI + Camera, set locale, timezone, keyboard
    and wificountry.

reboot ! mandatory!

after rebooting to terminal:
			
			1.	wget http://www.plenkyman.com/installthedoor.sh
			2.	sh installthedoor.sh
			
This will take around 20 minutes, you will have to accept 3 prompts and enter a root password for mysql.
The Rasperry will shut down when installation is finished.

After reboot run the SetupCards.py by running setupcards in terminal.
follow prompts to set up the programming and your personal access card.

#############################		setting up the cards		#######################

If you have followed the installation instructions you should now have cards to write new cards,
House or Guest.
- Swipe Make(HouseOrGuest)Cards once, all LED go on.
- Swipe the new unknown card, only red LED stays on.
- New Card is programmed.
- The MakeCards can be disabled by the OverRide Card.

Use MySQLWorkbench to edit Name of cards.

There are 5 types of cards defined by the value of "access" in database RfidDoor table RfidCards:
0 access revoked
1 access granted 24/7 ( the entries for schedules are not evaluated for these cards)
2 accces granted by schedules (weekdays and weekends)
3 OverRide (opens door permanently until swiped again)
4 make house cards (swipe this card, then the new card to make a house card, canceled by OverRide)
5 make guest cards (swipe this card, then the new card to make a guest card, canceled by OverRide)

number 2 cards "access granted by schedule":
- setting up accessable days: any mixture of 0 - 6, each encapsulated by ' and seperated by , in weekdays
  0 = Monday, 1= Tuesday, 2 = Wednesday, 3 = Thursday, 4 = Friday, 5 = Saturday, 6 = Sunday
- setting opening hour weekdays: any integer 0 - 24 in hours_wk_st
- setting closing hour weekdays: any integer 0 - 24 in hours_wk_end
- setting opening hour weekend: any integer 0 - 24 in hours_wkend_st
- setting closing hour weekend: any integer 0 - 24 in hours_wkend_end

#############################	   using the program in terminal	#######################

the program should run itself by means of crontab and scripts on error exit.

- crontab is starting door at boot and restarting every 4 hours (because TheDoor runs in userland!)
  at 6:59, 10:59, 14,59, 18:59, 22:59 (executed in about 1.5 seconds)
- crontab reboots the pi at 2:59 each night (executed in about 32 seconds)
- crontab backups mysql database RfidDoor at 2:57 each night

the easiest way to manage and setup cards is by using MySQLWorkbench over ssh.

newly available commands in terminal: 

restartdoor		tries to quit the reader and the python file then restarts them again
quitdoor		quits the rc522_reader and the python program
restartpi01		restarts pi and starts the door at boot 
dbdoor			shows the last 100 entries of mysql database AccLog Attendance
dbcards			shows mysql databas RfidCards all cards
lpi				shows logs of the custom scripts executed   
ldoor			shows logs of attendance
cleanlogs		erases all but the last 500 lines of lpi and ldoor
backupdoor		backs up to another machine by rsync if path and login are defined in TheDoorConfig.py,
				wait for command line prompt to enter password.
resetconfig		reset TheDoorConfig file and create doorconf, run after changes in TheDoorConfig.py,
				then run restartdoor.
setupcards		use this to setup the first 4 cards as programming cards
